<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>A varied background of disciplines, I spent many years building bodies, I've now made the switch to building websites, with the same meticulous attention paid as when someone's health goals are on the line</p>

<p>I've quickly come to love coding and development and love the challenge it provides - who doesn't love playing word games for a living?</p>

<p>A full portfolio of work is available to view and I'm always happy to show off my skills for any special requests</p>
